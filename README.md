A very simple and low-level animation library for your Java project.

The library provides utilities for:

* **keyframe animation** of values over time
* **elastic values** (change values smoothly over time)

*The name [Animatronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatronics) is a homage to mechatronic puppets which are often used in films and in theme park attractions.*

## Usage

The library requires JDK 9 or higher.

### Keyframe animation of a value

In order to animate a value over different steps you can simply use the ```Animatronic``` classes:

```Java

// Initialize and configure your animation (timeline).
AnimatronicDouble animation = new AnimatronicDouble(1.0d)
        .keyframe(1.3d, 5000, Easings.easeInOutBack())
        .keyframe(5.4d, 3000, Easings.easeInOutCubic());

// ...

// Start the animation at some point in time.
animation.play();        

// ...

// Use the interpolated value at the current point in time
// (for example when drawing the value on the screen).        
double currentValue = animation.getValue();

```


### Elastic values

When you're dealing with realtime values and you want to change the displayed value smoothly to that new value, you can use the ```Elastic``` classes.

An example:

```Java

// Initialize the value.
ElasticDouble value = new ElasticValue(0d, 1000, Easings.easeInOutCubic());

// When the realtime value changed, set the value.
value.setValue(15d)

// Use the interpolated value at the current point in time
// (for example when drawing the value on the screen).
double smoothedValue = value.getValue();

```


### Easing functions

The library comes with different predefined easing functions.

```Java

Easing ease1 = Easings.easeInBack();
Easing ease2 = Easings.easeInOutCubic();
// ... and so on.

// You can use the easing functions without
// an animatronic or an elastic value:
double easedValue = ease1.ease(0.1d);

```

You can add your own easing functions by implementing the interface ```Easing```.

The predefined easing functions are inspired by [https://easings.net/](https://easings.net/).


### Extend the base classes

#### Custom animatronics

Use the abstract class ```Animatronic<T>``` in order to animate any object you want. Simply create a class which extends ```Animatronic``` and implement the ```calculateValueInBetween()``` method. The method calculates the interpolated value with the given factor. You can use the helper method ```calculateValue()``` to calculate the interpolated value without any hustle.

A good example is the ```AnimatronicPoint2D``` class:

```Java

public class AnimatronicPoint2D extends Animatronic<Point2D> {

    // ...
    
    @Override
    protected Point2D calculateValueInBetween(Point2D lastValue, Point2D nextValue, double factor) {
        return new Point2D.Double(
                // Calculate the interpolated coordinates:
                calculateValue(lastValue.getX(), nextValue.getX(), factor),
                calculateValue(lastValue.getY(), nextValue.getY(), factor)
        );
    }
}

```

The library has different default implementations:

* Double with ```AnimatronicDouble```
* Float with ```AnimatronicFloat```
* Integer with ```AnimatronicInteger```
* Color with ```AnimatronicColor```
* Point2D with ```AnimatronicPoint2D```

#### Custom elastic values

You can do the same with the abstract class ```Elastic<T>```:

A good example is the ```ElasticDouble``` class:

```Java

public class ElasticDouble extends Elastic<Double> {

    // ...

    @Override
    protected Double calculateValueInBetween(Double lastValue, Double nextValue, double factor) {
        return calculateValue(lastValue, nextValue, factor);
    }

}

```

The library has different default implementations:

* Double with ```ElasticDouble```
* Float with ```ElasticFloat```
* Integer with ```ElasticInteger```
* Color with ```ElasticColor```
* Point2D with ```ElasticPoint2D```
