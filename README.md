A very simple and low-level animation library for your Java project.

The name *Animatronic* is a homage to mechatronic puppets which are often used in films and in theme park attractions.

## Usage

The library requires JDK 9 or higher.

### Animate a simple value

```Java

// Initialize and configure your animation (timeline).
AnimatronicDouble animation = new AnimatronicDouble(1.0d)
        .keyframe(1.3d, 5000, Easings.easeInOutBack())
        .keyframe(5.4d, 3000, Easings.easeInOutCubic())
        .play();

// ...

// Start the animation at some point in time.
animation.play();        

// ...

// Use the current (interpolated) value when drawing.
double currentValue = animation.getValue();

```

### Animate any object

Use the abstract class ```Animatronic<T>``` in order to animate any object you want. Simply create a class which extends ```Animatronic``` and implement the ```calculateValueInBetween()``` method. The method calculates the interpolated value with the given factor. You can use the helper method ```calculateValue()``` to calculate the interpolated value without any hustle.

A good example is the ```AnimatronicPoint2D``` class:

```Java

public class AnimatronicPoint2D extends Animatronic<Point2D> {

    // ...
    
    @Override
    protected Point2D calculateValueInBetween(Point2D lastValue, Point2D nextValue, double factor) {
        return new Point2D.Double(
                // Calculate the interpolated coordinates:
                calculateValue(lastValue.getX(), nextValue.getX(), factor),
                calculateValue(lastValue.getY(), nextValue.getY(), factor)
        );
    }
}

```

The library has different default implementations:

* Double with ```AnimatronicDouble```
* Float with ```AnimatronicFloat```
* Integer with ```AnimatronicInteger```
* Color with ```AnimatronicColor```
* Point2D with ```AnimatronicPoint2D```


### Easing functions

The library comes with different predefined easing functions.

```Java

Easing e1 = Easings.easeInBack();
Easing e2 = Easings.easeInOutCubic();
// ... and so on.

```
